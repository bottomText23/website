			Hello <b>my nigga</b>, welcome to my website. This place is my own little silly garbage dump on the internet. Please feel free to look around if you think it will be worth your while.

				<p>
					2/9/24<br>
					Changed the layout of the homepage a bit and added the "updates" section.

					27/8/24<br>
					Started hosting the website on Github. I have my reasons for it, might detail in a blog post (once I get to that). 
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					21/6/24<br>
					Created the Gallery page and posted some of my pixel art. Will probably change the layout eventually.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					6/6/24<br>
					Created a WIP page, mostly for myself so I can make sure everything is linked properly.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					1/6/24<br>
					I think I'm quite happy with the current style I have going on for the website right now. It will likely stay similar to this, at least the color scheme.
				</p>

					31/5/24<br>
					Finally figured out how this whole server thing works. As of today the website is live, though it will take a lot of time to get it to look exactly the way I want.
